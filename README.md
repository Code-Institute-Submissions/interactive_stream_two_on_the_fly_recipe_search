# On the Fly


## Project Overview


### Website Purpose & Goals:

This website is designed as to provide users with the ability to provide one ingredient to a search function when they see a supermarket special offer or simply have a perishable ingredient hanging about in their fridge. As the nature of when users would need this app would often be when they are out and about shopping the website needs to have an app like feel and functionality.

The site is a single page site using an API to provide users with a simple and efficient solution to their food needs "On the Fly".

### Website Planning & Design Process:

#### 1. Initial Planning 

The planning commenced with pen and paper brainstorming and some competitor website analysis. Here website purpose and goals were laid out along with throughts on the type of feel and message the site ought to protray to the user. Competitor analysis was then carried out on other food recipe websites along with food mobile applications. It was at this point that the food API which would be used was decided upon also. Having reviewed several APIs, [Edamam](https://developer.edamam.com "Edamam Developer Portal") was chosed. This decision process was difficult and required consideration to be given a number of points. The API needed to be free to use which in itself places limitations on the development. The data format and fields were also important to research given that they would affect what features could be offered to the user. 

#### 2. User Stories

From here I decided to complete some user stories before commencing wireframing. This helped me to think through the user journey and design a good site map and navigation path. All user stories have been included in a file labelled "User Story" for project review.

#### 2. Wireframe

After the initial planning stage, analog pen and paper wireframes were completed. From here I developed these wireframes further using [Balsamiq](https://www.balsamiq.com "Balsamiq Homepage"). At this point I fine tuned down my features and layout. There were some cosmetic adjustments during the development process but on a whole the original mockups were followed quite closely. All wireframes have been included in a file labelled "Wireframe" for project review.



## Functionality and Technologies Used


### Functionality
This is a multipage website built using a Bootstrap framework for responsive layout. There is a clean sidebar which functions very well as a clear and user friendly filtering system. A hamburger menu appears on this when collapses and this animates into an X when open using a combination of CSS and Jquery.  

The main purpose of this site is to enable the user to easily search for a recipe using a single ingredient. The search bar therefore takes pride of place at the top of the page under the logo.

### Technologies Used

- HTML5 
- CSS3 - Along with using CSS for styling this was also used to create the side filtering menu.
- [Bootstrap Version 3](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/ "Bootstrap 3 Homepage")  - used for responsive layout of both the homepage and search results.
- Javascript - javascript has been used to connect to the API and return results in optimal format to the HTML.
- [Jquery](https://jquery.com/Jquery "Jquery Homepage") - Jquery has been used on the sidebar filter menu.
